<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>I am kind of new to Github and was just checking out how everything over here works, my experience so far has been good, given I was sent here as because my academics asked me to learn more about Open Source. I might like to make new friends and well see ya, have a nice day wherever you are.</p>
<p>You can visit my Github profile <a href="https://github.com/waizjuzar">here</a></p>
<p>There isn't much I've done over here right now and well this is also my first action on this platform. :D</p>
